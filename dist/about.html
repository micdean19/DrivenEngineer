                            English. I am a practicising Christian, and a strong believer that we make this
                            world a better place by showing kindness regardless of our internal and external struggles.
                            My hobbies consist of coding, hiking and watching/playing soccer. If I'm not at

                            I am in my final year of Geomatics Engineering with a long list
                            of success and awards under my name. From 2016 to 2018 I was in a biomedical specializaton
                            before getting into a computer science minor in 2019. I registered in
                            the department of Geomatics Engineering because of my
                            interest in lidar data, GNSS (Global Navigation Satelite Systems) positioning and autonomous
                            driving. In the future I would like to get involved in autonomy and deep learning.
                            <br> <br>
                            I plan on going into further education with a master of engineering in software development
                            at the University of Calgary. I hope to learn new modern technoogy such as Machine Learning,
                            Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning and how they can contribute to autonomy.
                            Afterwards I hope to enter a graduate program in applied computer science at Dalhousie
                            University. They have a strong program in mobile computing, data management
                            and
                            machine learning.

                            In recent years, I’ve been an active leader in my community while excelling in my academics.
                            I volunteer at my local church on weekends and help organize
                            events at
                            school with the Geomatics Engineering Student Society as their vice president. I
                            occasionally
                            volunteer at the drop-in center, the mustard seed and at “feed the hungry” events!
                            <br><br>
                            In the past, I have been involved with Fuse Collective in helping design a shelter for twin
                            view community garden. Fuse collective is an engineering and design club that creates,
                            designs and participates in real initiatives with real-world impact. Right now, I am
                            mentoring two engineering students through the Seymour Schulich Scholars program.

                            I am also a frequent contributor to various charities such as the Tom Baker Center, Children
                            Believe, the
                            World Food Programme and the Plan International Canada. I have a strong predisposition and
                            inclination to the crisis in the middle
                            east (especially Syria and Yemen) and I'd like to take this opportunity to invite to help
                            dying and starving children. There are plenty of ways to help including monetary donations,
                            spreading the word or even mentioning it to your friend at wings night!

                            combinining new positioning systems with modern technology to design an LRT station in the
