                        <p class="text-justify">Hello there! I'm Michael Ah and I'd like to thank you for browsing my
                            website. If you don't
                            know me, I am a passionate and joyful person by nature.

                            I come from a small african island called Mauritius, thus I speak fluent French, Creole and
                            English. I am a practicising Christian, and I am a strong believer that we make this
                            world a better place by showing kindness regardless of our internal and external struggles.
                            My hobbies consist of coding, hiking and watching/playing soccer. If I'm not at
                            my desk
                            answering your emails, you'll have to come find me in the mountains!
                            <br> <br>
                            I am currently employed at Hexagon Autonomy & positioning as an R&D
                            Engineering Intern. I have industry experience in software development, research and
                            working on agile teams. On the side, I am an investor with experience day trading.
                            My long term portfolios are into dividends and technological stocks (bullish).
                            <br> <br>
                            My favorite sitcoms are Brooklyn99, How I met your mother and Big Bang theory (Sorry Office
                            lovers). Unfortunately, if you don't listen to Avril Lavigne, I don't think we can be good
                            friends. </p>

                            of success and awards under my name. I registered in
                            the department of geomatics engineering because of my
                            interest in lidar data, GNSS (Global Navigation satelite systems) positioning and autonomous
                            driving. In the future I would like to get involved in autonomy and deep learning.

                            I plan on going to a master’s in software engineering at the University of Calgary then

                            Dalhousie (Halifax). They have a strong program in mobile computing, data management
                            and
                            machine learning.

                            In recent years, I’ve been an active leader in my community by mentoring my peers,
                            volunteering at my local church and partaking in various charities. All of my commitments
                            were done while still excelling in my academic.

                            volunteer at the drop-in center, the mustard seed and at “feed the hungry” events!

                            In the past, I have been involved with Fuse Collective in helping design a shelter for twin

                            designs and participates in real initiatives with real-world impact. Right now, I am
